I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science and am expected to finish all the degree requirements by August, 2015. My primary research interests lie in developing effective quantitative tools in evaluating and managing risks in the fields of insurance and finance, with a special attention in agricultural risk management.
